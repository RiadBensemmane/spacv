# `spacv`: spatial cross-validation in Python

`spacv` is a small Python 3 (3.6 and above) package for cross-validation of models
that assess generalization performance to datasets with spatial dependence. Spacv offloads technical
considerations required to implement convincing spatial predictive methods from the user, releasing 
greater creative freedoms to researchers interested in problem cases that necessitate attention to the dimension of space.
See the notebook `spacv_guide.ipynb` for usage.
