# `spacv`: spatial cross-validation in Python

`spacv` is a small Python 3 (3.6 and above) package for cross-validation of models
that assess generalization performance to datasets with spatial dependence. Spacv provides
a familiar sklearn-like API to expose a suite of tools useful for points-based spatial prediction tasks.
See the notebook `spacv_guide.ipynb` for usage.
