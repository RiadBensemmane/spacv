# `spacv`: spatial cross-validation in Python

`spacv` is a small Python 3 (3.6 and above) package for cross-validation of models
that assess generalization performance to datasets with spatial dependence. Spacv offloads technical
challenges required to implement spatial predictive methods from the user, releasing 
greater creative freedom to researchers interested in research problems that require an attention to space. 
See the notebook `spacv_guide.ipynb` for usage.
